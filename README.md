# Automated Semiconductor Fault Detection

A Python-based system for automating the detection and classification of faults in semiconductor manufacturing processes.

## Overview

This project aims to improve semiconductor manufacturing quality by implementing automated fault detection algorithms using machine learning techniques. Early detection of manufacturing defects can significantly reduce costs and improve product quality.

## Features

- Automated detection of semiconductor manufacturing faults
- Machine learning models for fault classification
- Data processing pipeline for semiconductor manufacturing data
- Visualization tools for fault analysis

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/saverin0/automated-semiconductor-fault-detection.git
cd automated-semiconductor-fault-detection

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
# Example code for using the fault detection system
from fault_detection import FaultDetector

# Initialize the detector
detector = FaultDetector()

# Load and process data
detector.load_data("path/to/semiconductor_data.csv")

# Run fault detection
results = detector.detect_faults()

# Visualize results
detector.visualize_results(results)
```
