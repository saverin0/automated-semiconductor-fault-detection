Automated Semiconductor Fault Detection
This project aims to automate the detection of faults in semiconductor manufacturing using machine learning. It provides a robust pipeline for data validation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, ensuring high-quality and reliable fault detection for semiconductor production lines.

Features
Automated Data Validation: Ensures incoming data meets schema and quality requirements before processing.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.
Model Training & Evaluation: Trains machine learning models to detect faults and evaluates their performance using industry-standard metrics.
Pipeline Integration: Seamlessly integrates all steps from raw data ingestion to model inference.
Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive logging for traceability and easy debugging.
Modular Codebase: Organized into clear modules for validation, transformation, database operations, and modeling.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
pip (Python package manager)
(Optional) Virtual environment tool (e.g., venv or conda)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy Code
git clone https://github.com/saverin0/automated-semiconductor-fault-detection.git
cd automated-semiconductor-fault-detection
Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
bash
Copy Code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy Code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables:
Edit the .env file to set up paths and credentials as needed.
Usage
Data Validation & Preprocessing:
Place your raw data files in the data/ directory.
Run the validation and transformation scripts in src/ to clean and prepare your data.
Model Training:
Use the training scripts in src/ to train and evaluate your machine learning models.
Prediction:
Once trained, use the model inference scripts to predict faults on new data.
Logging
All logs are saved in the logs/ directory for easy monitoring and debugging.
